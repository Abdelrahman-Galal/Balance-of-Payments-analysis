# Balance Of Payment (BOP)

The balance of payments (BOP) is a statement of all transactions made between entities in one country and the rest of the world over a defined period of time, such as a quarter or a year.

The balance of payments divides transactions in two accounts: the current account and the capital account.The current account which is analysed here includes transactions in goods, services, investment income, and current transfers. The capital account, broadly defined, includes transactions in financial instruments and central bank reserves.
